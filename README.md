# Prez
Prez is a Linked Data API framework tool that delivers read-only access to Knowledge Graph data according to particular domain _profiles_.

Prez comes in two main profile flavours:

- _VocPrez_ - for vocabularies, based on the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) data model
- _SpacePrez_ - for spatial data, based on [OGC API](https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html) specification and the [GeoSPARQL](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/geosparql11/spec.html) data model

Prez is pretty straight-forward to install and operate and while being high-performance, using modern [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) Python web framework. 

Prez is quite simple and expects "high quality" data to work well. By requiring that you create high quality for it, Prez ensures your value is retained in your data and not in a black box application: you remain in control!
